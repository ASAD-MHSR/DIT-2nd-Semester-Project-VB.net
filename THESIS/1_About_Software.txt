A Contact Management System is a computer program specifically designed to store, 
manage, and retrieve contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email 
addresses. It provides a digital version of a physical address book, allowing 
users to keep track of their personal and professional connections in an organized 
way.

This software is highly useful for individuals and small businesses to maintain 
a clean database of communication details. It allows users to quickly add new 
entries, search for existing contacts, and ensure that important information is 
never lost. By using a structured interface, it simplifies the process of data 
entry and management, making it much more efficient than writing details on paper.

Modern contact managers often include features like search filters, easy editing 
of existing records, and the ability to list all saved contacts at once. These 
features make communication faster and help users stay organized in their daily 
lives.
